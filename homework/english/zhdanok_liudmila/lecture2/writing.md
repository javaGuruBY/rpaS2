# Writining task

I have started to learn JAVA 4 or 5 monthes ago, when riots broke out in our country. 
That time I was thinking about  relocating in Europe and IT was a good idea for it. 
But now I'm really intrested in JAVA.
What do I like about JAVA?
I like maths, algorithms and clear programming structure.
I think this job really can benefit people and companys.
I hope this profession will give me more freedom of finance and movement.
And I'm sure it's great to change my life sometimes.
I'm sure that I will become JAVA Developer in the near future.
